# DeMoDulation
A public guide on making a DeMoD device. It consists of three main systems that turn into a cohesive platform for a wide range of use cases. The RT core isolated kernel with nix is perfect for scaling and standardization. A 24 bit with 192khz capabilities paired with a quad core CPU and 4+ GB of RAM allows the RT kernel to become a functional DSP.
